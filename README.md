This assignment was very difficult for me to do. I am new to coding, but usually can figure it out. LESS was not easy for me to set up. I did get that fixed by the lecture, it helped with the blank white screen error by having a live server in VS code. However, the rest of this assignment went completely over my head. I understand that I did not complete this assignment fully and will be graded accordingly. If I may add a suggestion, is it possible to go step by step of how to do the next assignments. I cannot speak for everyone else, but I was taught using ATOM and now using VS Code as well as LESS and javascript it is very difficult for me to understand. I used many websites and forums to try to figure assignment 3 out.
